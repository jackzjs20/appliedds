# Introduction/Business Understanding
	In recent years, scientists have paid more and more attention to the potential factors that would cause car accidents. This involves not only identify the reasons behinds those accidents, but also develops ways to warn drivers forehead to alleviate the severity of accidents or even avoid damages at all. The common factors as identified in official reports of an accident include speeding, driving under influence, weather conditions, road condition, and whether or not the pedestrian right of way was granted, etc. Before any preventative methods can be taken, it is necessary to understand the relationship between those factors and the severity of the incidents. The objective of the research is to design a machine learning model to predict the severity of accidents based on those factors. In this case, when the machine learning model detaches a potentially risky situation, law enforcement and traffic management system can send out warning signals to prevent the collision from happening. Another benefit of this model is that through data exploration, the common contributing factor to accidents, if it is possible, can be discouraged. If speeding leads more much more severe accidents, a much harsh punishment for speeding can discourage drivers from surpassing the speed limit and reduce the likelihood of a risk situation.
